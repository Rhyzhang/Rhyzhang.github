Hi! I am a student who is fascinated by technology's ability to improve the lives of humans all around the world. I am passionate about developing systems that benefit society as a whole. In my free time, I love exploring deep rabbit holes in economics, history, policy, and artificial intelligence. My dream is to contribute to AI research and craft AI policy for the nation and potentially the world.
